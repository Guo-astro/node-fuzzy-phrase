# *Here we run tests*
# We prefer running tests in the 'before_script' section rather than 'script' to ensure fast failure.
# Be aware that if you use the 'script' section it will continue running all commands in the section even if one line fails.
# This is documented at https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build#Breaking-the-Build
# We don't want this behavior because otherwise we might risk publishing builds when the tests did not pass.
# For this reason, we disable the 'script' section below, since we prefer using 'before_script'.

  - npm test
